Redis is an open-sourced (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It is often referred as a *data structures* server. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a *server-client* model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.
