Why use a task runner? In a word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc., the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it through a `Gruntfile`, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you with basically zero effort.
