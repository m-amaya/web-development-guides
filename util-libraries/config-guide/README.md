`node-config` organizes hierarchical configurations for your app deployments. It lets you define a set of default parameters, and extend them for different deployment environments (development, qa, staging, production, etc.). Configurations are stored in configuration files within your application, and can be overridden and extended by environment variables, command line parameters, or external sources.
