## Expect Guide
*Write better assertions.*

> **Github:** [https://github.com/mjackson/expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect)

When you use `expect`, you write assertions similarly to how you would say them, e.g. "I expect this value to be equal to 3" or "I expect this array to contain 3". When you write assertions in this way, you don't need to remember the order of actual and expected arguments of functions like `assert.equal`, which help you write better tests.
